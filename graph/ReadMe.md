### This mini-project created a graph class and implemented functions to operate on graph. The functions implemented currently allow us to solve the famous problem "The Travelling Salesman Problem".

The Travelling Salesman Problem: given a graph where each vertex is a city and each edge is the distance between two cities, find the shortest path that visits every city exactly once.
